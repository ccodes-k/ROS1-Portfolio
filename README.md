# ROS1-Portfolio


## Overview

ROS 1 (Robot Operating System) is a modular open-source middleware used to develop, simulate, and control robotic systems. This repository demonstrates ROS capabilities through projects like TurtleBot navigation and Gazebo simulations. In this project, Limo Robot uses ROS and its features to naviagte through obstacles in the arena with varying complexities.

### Contents

- Source code for ROS 1 projects
- Limo Robot usage
- ROS Navigation
- Arena Creation

## Limo Robot

- LiDAR and depth vision-based sensing (YDLIDAR XL2 & Orbbec Dabai)
- RViz visualization
- Nvidia Jetson Nano

The usage of the limo robot with its features such as a LiDAR and depth sensing camera helps with its own survival and reaching a specific goal.

## Arena Creation

### How Systems Approach can be applied into creating the arena
<p>Identifying and exploring problems or opportunities in detail.</p>
<p>Provides solutions that are realizable within time, cost, and risk constraints.</p>
<p>Defines what the system is used for</p>
<p>Function is distinct from behavior</p>
<p>Drives realizable system descriptions</p>
<p>Critical to aligning with stakeholder goal</p>
