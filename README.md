# ROS1-Portfolio


## Overview

ROS 1 (Robot Operating System) is a modular open-source middleware used to develop, simulate, and control robotic systems. This repository demonstrates ROS capabilities through projects like TurtleBot navigation and Gazebo simulations. In this project, Limo Robot uses ROS and its features to naviagte through obstacles in the arena with varying complexities.

## Limo Robot

- LiDAR and depth vision-based sensing (YDLIDAR XL2 & Orbbec Dabai)
- RViz visualization
- Nvidia Jetson Nano

The usage of the limo robot with its features such as a LiDAR and depth sensing camera helps with its own survival and reaching a specific goal.

## Arena Creation

### How Systems Approach can be applied into creating the arena
1. Identifying & Understanding Problems and Opportunities<br>
    &nbsp;Application to Arena Creation:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Define the purpose of the arena (e.g., testing robot navigation, obstacle avoidance, SLAM).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Identify requirements from stakeholders (e.g., researchers, students, engineers).<br>
        <\t><\t>Recognize constraints like space availability, budget, safety, and types of robots.<br>
        <\t><\t>Example: The robot struggles with uneven surfaces or tight corners—highlighting a need to include such elements in the arena for better testing.<br>

2. Synthesizing Possible Solutions<br>
    <\t>Application to Arena Creation:<br>
        <\t><\t>Brainstorm different layouts and obstacle types (ramps, tunnels, rough terrain, markers).<br>
        <\t><\t>Consider materials for construction (wood, foam, 3D-printed parts).<br>
        <\t><\t>Think about how to make the arena modular or reconfigurable for different tests.<br>
        <\t><\t>Example: Propose zones with different difficulty levels—basic navigation, dynamic obstacles, or line following.<br>

3. Analysis & Selection between Alternative Solutions<br>
    <t>Application to Arena Creation:<br>
        <t>Evaluate each proposed layout for cost, realism, challenge level, safety, and learning objectives.<br>
        <t>Use simulations or scaled models to test how effective each design is for robot tasks.<br>
        <t>Choose the design that offers the best balance between challenge and feasibility.<br>
        <t>Example: Select a hexagonal layout over a linear one because it allows for more complex path planning.<br>

4. Implementing and Proving a Solution<br>
    <t>Application to Arena Creation:<br>
        <t>Build the physical arena based on the chosen design.<br>
        <t>Test it with mobile robots to ensure it meets goals (e.g., robot can map the area, avoid obstacles, and return to start).<br>
        <t>Fix construction issues or robot interaction problems during test runs.<br>
        <t>Example: Adjust obstacle height if robots consistently fail to detect them.<br>

5. Deploying, Using, & Sustaining Systems to Solve Problems<br>
    <t>Application to Arena Creation:<br>
        <t>Begin regular use of the arena for training, experimentation, or competitions.<br>
        <t>Collect feedback from users and iterate the design (e.g., add moving obstacles or tracking cameras).<br>
        <t>Develop a maintenance plan to keep the arena in good condition.<br>
        <t>Example: Replace worn floor markings or update the layout for new robot capabilities.<br>
