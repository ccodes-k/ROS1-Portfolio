# ROS1-Portfolio


## Overview

ROS 1 (Robot Operating System) is a modular open-source middleware used to develop, simulate, and control robotic systems. This repository demonstrates ROS capabilities through projects like TurtleBot navigation and Gazebo simulations. In this project, Limo Robot uses ROS and its features to naviagte through obstacles in the arena with varying complexities.
